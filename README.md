GitHub does not support rendering math inserted in the markdown file, while it's too bothering convert them to pictures (lazy actually). 
To read these notes, download them. Installing *MathJax Plugin for Github* on your *Chrome* sounds like a reasonable choice, but the plugin doesn't supports some latex symbols such as "\oiint", the surface integral.
