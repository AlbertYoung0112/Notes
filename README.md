GitHub does not support rendering math inserted in the markdown file, while it's bothering to convert them to pictures (lazy actually), so that if you want to read these notes, download them. Installing *MathJax Plugin for Github* on your browser sounds like a reasonable choice, but the plugin doesn't supports some latex symbols such as the surface integral "\oiint".
